AM2R Map and Item Tracker
==========

This is toll meant to help players of AM2R more easily keep track of what items they have collected.

Currently only Windows and Linux are planned to be supported.

##Planned features:
- An interactive map featuring useful information, including item locations and
collection status, the locations of bosses and their alive/death status, etc.
    - User should be able to distinguish between collect/un-collected items, 
    different types of bosses (including each type of Metroid)
    - Views of each Area of the game are planned
- An interactive panel showing each type of item and their collection status
    - Non-unique items will have counters for both number of
    the item collected and the maximum ammo/energy that amount
    provides
- Automatic tracking of the information above
     - Currently only supporting save file based tracking
     - Real time tracking is planned, but not currently feasible
     - Data retrieval from AM2R save files is powered by v2.8 of [unknown's AM2R Save File Editor](https://gitlab.com/an-unknown/am2r-savefile/-/tree/master/)
